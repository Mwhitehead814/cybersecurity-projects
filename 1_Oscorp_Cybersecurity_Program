# Oscorp Cybersecurity Program

## Executive Summary
Oscorp Industries, a high-tech R&D company, offered a Senior Cybersecurity Consultant role with the directive to build a comprehensive cybersecurity program from the ground up. This project includes a full analysis of their current cybersecurity posture, alignment to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and a 3-year strategic roadmap to uplift maturity and resilience.

## Objectives
- Assess current cybersecurity controls across key domains.
- Map gaps against the NIST CSF functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
- Deliver a prioritized 3-year roadmap with strategic and technical initiatives.

## Tools & Frameworks
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Microsoft Excel (Gap matrix + roadmap)
- Google Docs (Reporting)
- MITRE ATT&CK (Threat-informed defense reference)
- Microsoft Office 365, Azure (Oscorp environment context)

## Key Activities
1. Reviewed Oscorp’s current cybersecurity state across 15 domains.
2. Mapped controls to NIST CSF and rated maturity (from spreadsheet).
3. Identified critical gaps in risk management, detection, policy, and IAM.
4. Developed a 3-year roadmap with phased improvements by CSF function.
5. Created executive-level documentation and recommendations.

## Findings Summary
- No formal cybersecurity governance or strategy in place.
- Shared admin credentials, no MFA, no privileged access management.
- Qualys scanner exists but no vulnerability program or patch SLA.
- No SIEM or detection/response platform implemented.
- One generic IT policy; no formal infosec, DLP, or data classification policies.
- No third-party or technology risk management process.

## 3-Year Roadmap (Sample Highlights)
**Year 1 – Stabilize**
- Establish security governance (roles, policies, responsibilities)
- Implement MFA and PAM
- Launch vulnerability management program with Qualys
- Begin employee security awareness training

**Year 2 – Formalize**
- Deploy SIEM (e.g., Splunk or Sentinel) and develop detection rules
- Implement third-party risk assessment process
- Create incident response playbooks and tabletop exercises
- Launch data classification and DLP initiative

**Year 3 – Optimize**
- Conduct full GRC audit against NIST CSF
- Mature threat hunting capabilities
- Align security with business continuity and risk quantification
- Automate security operations (SOAR tools, integrations)

## Outcomes
- Delivered a 3-year strategic plan to executive leadership.
- Mapped 100% of findings to CSF domains for clear governance alignment.
- Identified quick wins and long-term controls across the entire org.
